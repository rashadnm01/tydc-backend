# The Young Developer Committee Backend Development Project

## This project is currently in the beginning stages of development, and will also be used as a training resource for other developers.

## First step in this project after the npm init and git remote, is to npm i dotenv mongoose cors express. These are the dependencies that I am starting with, and will add more as we go. If you have forked the repo, do npm i.
